## 🚀 Core Projects

### ⚡ LLM Generation Optimization
- Boosted model accuracy by 90% via constrained decoding techniques
- Productionized Hugging Face & VLLM pipelines
- **Open-Source Contribution**: Added prompt tokens support to VLLM's Logits Processor ([#4985](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/4985))

### 🎓 Educational Course Automation
- Built ETL pipeline: PDF parsing (Nougat) → deduplication → LLM enrichment
- Automated theory generation & structural linking
- Orchestrated 24-GPU cluster (6×4xA100) with Prometheus/Grafana monitoring
- Achieved 3x throughput using VLLM with dynamic load balancing

### 📚 Git Documentation Toolkit
- Reduced manual docs effort by 60% via auto-README generation
- Developed context-aware summarization preserving documentation style

### 🤖 Multi-functional AI Agent on LLM
- Architected LLM agent converting NLP queries to API call sequences (action planning)
- Implemented hybrid argument extraction: slot filling + default values
- Integrated with Google Calendar, Todoist, Gmail (+ extensible architecture)
- Developed context preservation system improving planning accuracy by 40%
